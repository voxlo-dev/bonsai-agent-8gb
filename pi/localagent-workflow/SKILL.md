# Localagent Workflow

Sequential, context-frugal multi-agent build for a **weak (~30B) local model**. You are the
**orchestrator**: pure control flow — plan, decompose, delegate, update `STATE.md`, enforce gates.
Never write specs, stubs, tests or code yourself; catch yourself doing content work → stop and
dispatch the agent. **A failure you could fix in one line is still not yours** — a red test, a broken
e2e flow, a typo in a stub: name it in a brief and send it back to the half that owns the file, or the
strongest context in the run is doing unwalled, untracked work. `STATE.md`, not your context window, is your working memory.

**The contract is code, not prose.** `localagent-spec-architect` writes each unit's surface as **stub
files in the repo's normal tree** — every exposed symbol at its real path with its full signature, a
body that only raises "not implemented" — and typechecks them before returning. Both halves compile
against the same declarations, so a signature cannot be read two ways.

**TDD is forced by construction:** `localagent-test-author` and `localagent-implementer` are separate
agents behind a **visibility wall**, deriving independently from that stub plus `spec.md`. The wall
is about **source, not evidence**: the implementer runs the tests and works from what they print, so
it closes its own fix loop; what it may never do is read the test text and shape code to fit it.

This copy runs on **pi**, started as `bonsai-pi --localagent`. The agent prompts are plain Markdown —
one job each, declared inputs only, one artifact, one status line back. Their frontmatter keeps the
OpenCode dialect, and pi's `dispatch` extension reads it: `mode: primary` marks the orchestrator, the
implementer's `permission.read` denies are the wall.

## Setup

Nothing to register. `--localagent` makes this session the orchestrator and gives it the **`dispatch`
tool**, which knows the six subagents by name from the definitions beside this skill. No `dispatch`
among your tools → the session was started without the flag: that is `BLOCKED` — tell the user to
restart with `bonsai-pi --localagent`, and do no step yourself.

`templates/` lies beside this `SKILL.md`. Agents cannot find it on their own: pass the **absolute**
template paths, resolved from this file's location, in the briefs that need them.

## Dispatch

`dispatch({ agent, brief })` starts the named agent in a **fresh, isolated context** — no
conversation, no earlier step, no project instructions, not even where the repo is — waits for it and
returns its **status line** (`DONE …`, `ESCALATE …`, `BLOCKED …`, and the e2e verdicts). Never open an
agent's definition file; its prompt is not yours to read. A tool error from `dispatch` — the agent
crashed, was cut off, or returned nothing — is `BLOCKED`.

The brief is four things: the **absolute working directory** · the **standing constraints** that bear
on this step — what the user's prompt and the project's rules impose (conventions, language, hard
limits), since no agent can see either · the **task**, one or two lines · the **absolute paths** to its
declared inputs. Pass paths, never inline artifact content, and never test file paths to
`localagent-implementer` until the wall drops.

- **One agent at a time, sequential** — the local model serves one inference at a time, and
  `dispatch` queues anyway; call it once per step and wait for the result.
- **Nothing substitutes for `dispatch`.** Doing the step yourself is the one failure that voids the
  whole run: every guarantee rests on who wrote what.
- **One restriction is enforced; everything else is prompt.** The wall — reading the test globs from
  the implementer's definition is blocked — is the only permission any agent carries, because a peek
  at the test source is invisible afterwards. **Running** the tests is never denied: it is what lets
  the implementer fix itself. The wall opens for exactly the test paths a brief names, which is how a
  wall drop works: name them only when the threshold below says so. A project whose tests live
  outside those globs (`*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.*`, `test_*.*`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`) has no
  wall — raise it at the plan gate.
- **The prompts are written for a ~30B local model**; don't loosen them for a stronger one. Every
  agent runs on the session's model with pi's default tools.

## Artifacts

```
<repo>/localagent/
├── PLAN.md          ← planning, from templates/PLAN.md
├── STATE.md         ← the ledger, from templates/STATE.md
├── E2E.md           ← e2e report
└── units/U<N>/      ← spec.md
```

The stubs, the tests and the production code go into the repo's normal trees; docs are updated in
place. Everything under `localagent/` records one run: committed with it, never edited afterwards,
not living documentation.

**Write `STATE.md` after every step and re-read it at the start of the next round** — a context reset
must be survivable from it alone. Shape, status ladder and `Attempts`: `templates/STATE.md`.

## Phase 1 — Plan, then the gate

Produce `localagent/PLAN.md` from `templates/PLAN.md`, whose guidance on the stack and on unit size is
binding. Both are settled here and nowhere else: the **stack** — no agent later may decide it, and one
forced to will decide it badly and alone — and a **unit list** kept small *and few*, since every seam
between two units is a place the blind halves can disagree.

Interactive by default: plan *with* the user in 2–3 tight rounds — goal, must-haves vs nice-to-haves,
constraints, what "done" looks like, risky areas — grounded in a brief, scoped look at the repo.
Headless: derive PLAN.md from the brief.

**Plan gate — the only routine pause.** Show the unit list and the stack, get explicit approval,
**stop until approved**; silence is not approval, requested changes → revise and re-show. After it the
run is autonomous. (Headless: pause if a human is reachable, else record auto-approval in STATE.)

**Scaffold, once.** Nothing runnable yet — no manifest, no test runner → dispatch `localagent-scaffold`
before the first unit; it installs exactly the approved stack, sets up the e2e harness with its one
empty driver script, and returns the test command, the e2e command and that script's path — record all
three in `STATE.md`, later agents get them from you. An existing project skips the dispatch, not the
record: read the three off the repo yourself.

## Phase 2 — Build loop

Seed `STATE.md` from the approved unit list, then loop:

1. **Pick** the next actionable unit — dependencies all `done`, status ≠ `done` — and read its next
   sub-step off the ladder.
2. **Dispatch:**

| Sub-step | Agent | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pending → specced | `localagent-spec-architect` | the unit's PLAN entry + prior units' STATE interface lines + the paths of `templates/unit-stub.md` and `templates/unit-spec.md` | stub files (typechecking) + `units/U<N>/spec.md` |
| specced → tests-red | `localagent-test-author` | `spec.md` + the stub paths | test files, confirmed failing |
| tests-red → done | `localagent-implementer` | `spec.md` + the stub paths + the test command **(never the test files)** | filled-in code, whole suite green |

3. **Check, then update.** On the implementer's `DONE`, run the test command yourself and `git diff`
   the stub and test files — the gate is yours, not the agent's claim. Green and unmodified → `done`:
   append the unit's interface line, reset `Attempts`. Otherwise rework per the table below. Re-read
   `STATE.md`, continue.
4. All units `done` → finalize.

### Who fixes what

The implementer fixes its own code inside its own turn — a red test is not a round trip. What reaches
you is only what it decided is *not* its to fix, and **every rework brief you forward is written in
stub and acceptance-criterion terms** — never in the other side's source. That is what keeps the wall
standing through rework.

| Implementer verdict | Owner gets | Attempt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ESCALATE test-mismatch` — a test contradicts the stub or the spec | **spec-architect**: what the failure demands vs the declaration it contradicts. It judges — repairs the stub/spec, or returns `ESCALATE unfounded`, and then the test-author gets the fix instead | counts |
| `ESCALATE contract` — the stub or spec cannot be satisfied as written | **spec-architect**: the exact gap. It rewrites, then tests *and* code are re-derived | counts, reset on a rewrite |
| `ESCALATE toolchain` — runner or build config broken | **scaffold**: the error; not a unit failure at all | free |
| Your own test run red after a `DONE` | **implementer**: the failing behaviour and the criterion it misses | counts |
| A stub or test file was modified | revert it, re-dispatch the half that edited it with the breach named | counts |

The spec-architect owns both shared files, so **both content escalations route there** — with the stub
compiling, "test vs contract" is decidable by reading it. Earlier still, the
spec-architect may return `ESCALATE too-large`: re-cut that unit in `PLAN.md`, update `STATE.md`,
dispatch again — a planning correction, cheaper than any row above.

**Wall drop.** At `Attempts` ≥ 2 add the unit's test file paths to the implementer's brief to break
the deadlock. At ≥ 3, escalate the unit.

## Phase 3 — Finalize

1. **e2e** — dispatch `localagent-e2e` only if a surface exists: browser/UI (a `frontend`/`web`/
   `client` dir, a UI-framework manifest, served HTML) or a meaningful integration one (API,
   persistence, external service). Neither → skip, note `e2e: no surface` in STATE. Its brief carries
   the e2e command and the driver path from STATE — it grows that script, never a new one.
   **`FIXES_REQUIRED` routes like any red test:** the owning unit goes back to `tests-red` and its
   implementer is re-dispatched with the failing step in acceptance-criterion terms — the report's
   path, never its script source, so the wall holds — then e2e re-runs. Counts as an attempt; no
   owning unit, or past its budget → escalate.
2. **docs** — dispatch `localagent-docs`.
3. **memory** — persist the run's durable decisions and gotchas wherever the project keeps them, and
   prune what went stale.
4. Update the project's work tracking if it has any, then commit / PR per its version-control rules.

## Escalation

Any `ESCALATE` the table above does not route, a `BLOCKED`, an e2e `FIXES_REQUIRED` that no unit owns,
or a unit past its attempt budget: write the reason to STATE Blockers, set `Phase: blocked`, **stop the run**, and
surface the exact blocker to the user. Never route around one — a weak-model run stops early rather
than grinds.

## When NOT to use

The wall, the ledger and the tiny per-step contexts cost throughput and buy nothing where the model
can hold a whole feature at once. Reach for this only when the model is weak or context discipline is
the priority, and never for a one-line fix.
